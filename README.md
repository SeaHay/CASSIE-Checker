# CASSIE-Checker
### A BASH script to check if a word is CASSIE-Safe
---


Basically, if you want to know if a word is safe to use in the CASSIE command, [you have to look at this Steam guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1577299753) 

That's pretty awful to have to do constantly, so I made a tool to perform quick searches on the provided list in a command-line interface. 

To use the program, just type the beginning of a word you want to use, and matching CASSIE-Safe words will appear. 
This means that if you type out **GR**, the word **GR**APEFRUIT won't appear, but the word **GR**EEN will!

This tool only currently works in a BASH shell, which means that the script.sh file will typically only run on Macs and Linux machines.
However, you CAN run this program on Windows yet! 

To run the program on a Windows machine, you can use the [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to run BASH files. 
Once you have the WSL up and running, you can either run the script.sh file straight from your Linux window, or you can run the win_run.cmd file 
to do it for you. 

Please do let me know if you have any issues running this program, as I've only tested it on my own computer, and if you run into any issues, I'd like to help!

## Thank you for your time!
