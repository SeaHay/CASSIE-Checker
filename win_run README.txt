win_run is ONLY usable if you have WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) as a thing on your computer. I don't know nearly enough cmd wizardry to make a windows only file for this program, and I don't have enough time to figure it out in Java. 

If you have Linux, you can run the script.sh file there, and not need the win_run file. 

For either application to launch, the list file NEEDS to be in the same location as the script.sh file. I've made this as portable as I can, so the folder can really just go anywhere, but the files must remain as they are. 

Thank you for checking out my program, and at some point when I'm more confident in my Java, I'll make a universal GUI version for everyone to be able to run.  ;)
